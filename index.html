                    <span style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;">A</span>utomotive history is a long and storied one, full of twists and turns, triumphs and failures.
                    From the earliest steam powered vehicles in the late 18th century, to the electric self driving cars of today,
                    the story of the automobile is one of innovation and progress. <br> <hr>
                    In 1769, the first steam-powered vehicle was built by French military engineer Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. 
                    It was a cumbersome and unwieldy machine, but it was a start. 
                    Over the next century, inventors and engineers around the world continued to tinker with the idea of a self-propelled vehicle, using steam, electricity, and internal combustion engines as their power sources. <br> <hr>
                    One of the most significant figures in automotive history is Karl Benz, who in 1886 patented the first practical automobile powered by an internal combustion engine. 
                    Benz's three-wheeled vehicle, known as the "Benz Patent-Motorwagen," was a landmark achievement that paved the way for the modern car. <br> <hr>
                    The first mass-produced automobile was the Ford Model T, which rolled off the assembly line in 1908. 
                    This affordable and reliable car sparked a revolution in personal transportation and helped to pave the way for the suburbanization of America. 
                    In the decades that followed, the car industry continued to grow and evolve, with new technologies and designs emerging all the time. <br> <hr>
                    One of the most notable developments in recent automotive history is the rise of electric cars. 
                    With concerns about climate change and air pollution on the rise, more and more people are turning to electric cars as a clean and efficient alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles. 
                    Companies like Tesla and Nissan have led the charge in this area, producing sleek and stylish electric cars that are starting to rival their gas-powered counterparts in terms of performance and range. <br> <hr>
                    Another major development in the automotive industry is the rise of self-driving cars. 
                    With the help of advanced sensors and artificial intelligence, these vehicles are able to navigate roads and traffic without any input from a human driver. 
                    While self-driving cars are still in the early stages of development, they hold great promise for the future of transportation, offering the potential for safer and more efficient roads. <br> <hr>
                    In conclusion, the history of the automobile is one of constant innovation and progress. 
                    From the earliest steam-powered vehicles to the electric and self-driving cars of today, the story of the car is one of human ingenuity and determination. As the industry continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see what the future holds for the automobile.
